6.245199	8.234597	tony_abbott THE COALITION UNDERSTANDS
8.360508	9.669986	tony_abbott THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE
9.896626	14.253156	tony_abbott STRONGER COMMUNITIES WITHOUT A STRONGER ECONOMY TO SUSTAIN THEM
14.504978	23.343950	michelle_grattan TONY ABBOTT IS ADDRESSING THE FACT THAT PEOPLE SAY HE'S A BIG SPENDER HE'S EXTRAVAGANT THEREFORE HE WOULD NOT BE ECONOMICALLY RESPONSIBLE
23.495043	25.711082	michelle_grattan NOW WHAT HE IS SAYING IS THAT
25.962904	35.809165	michelle_grattan BEYOND THE BIG SIGNATURE POLICIES HE'S PUT OUT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE PAID PARENTAL LEAVE A VERY GENEROUS SCHEME AND SOME THINGS THAT WILL COME UP
36.086170	39.737597	michelle_grattan BUT BEYOND THOSE BIG POLICIES THAT WE KNOW ABOUT
39.913873	45.932432	michelle_grattan HE'S FUNDAMENTALLY NOT GOING TO BE PROMISING MUCH IN THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN THE WAY OF NEW SPENDING
45.932432	48.148470	tony_abbott LABOR SAYS IT SUPPORTS SMALLER GOVERNMENT
48.425475	50.767424	tony_abbott BUT HAS DONE ALMOST NOTHING TO BRING THIS ABOUT
51.195523	54.041118	tony_abbott ALMOST THE FIRST ACT OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT
54.141847	55.300230	tony_abbott WILL BE TO ESTABLISH
55.627600	59.530849	tony_abbott THIS COMMISSION OF AUDIT TO BRING GOVERNMENT BACK TO MANAGEABLE SIZE
59.681942	61.595794	michelle_grattan IN THIS MAJOR SPEECH HE'S
61.721705	63.131911	michelle_grattan ALSO PROMISED A
63.383734	66.229329	michelle_grattan AN AUDIT OF ALL GOVERNMENT SPENDING
66.430787	72.323434	michelle_grattan NOW THIS GOES BACK TO JOHN HOWARD PETER COSTELLO'S MODEL IN THE MID NINETIES WHERE
72.474528	79.852928	michelle_grattan THEY HAD UH A REVIEW RIGHT THROUGH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND OF COURSE THERE WERE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SAVINGS OUT OF THAT
80.004022	82.547429	tony_abbott THIS NO MORE THAN ONCE A DECADE REVIEW
82.673341	84.108729	tony_abbott OF WHAT GOVERNMENT DOES
84.259823	85.619664	tony_abbott AND HOW GOVERNMENT DOES IT
85.947034	90.555386	tony_abbott WILL REPORT WITHIN FOUR MONTHS TO THE TREASURER AND THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE
91.159760	92.015957	tony_abbott THAT WAY
92.242597	95.491108	tony_abbott THE OPERATIONS OF GOVERNMENT CAN BE IMPROVED AND STREAMLINED
95.692566	96.876132	tony_abbott WHILE THE NEW GOVERNMENT
97.027225	98.739619	tony_abbott HAS MAXIMUM POLITICAL CAPITAL
99.016624	100.477194	tony_abbott TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS
100.779381	105.538827	michelle_grattan BUT OF COURSE THE RISK FOR HIM POLITICALLY IN THAT IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN MOUNT
105.916561	111.003376	michelle_grattan UH A SCARE CAMPAIGN AND SAY WELL TONY ABBOTT'D CUT THIS CUT THAT
111.330746	112.892046	michelle_grattan PEOPLE WOULD BE SQUEEZED
113.320144	116.316832	michelle_grattan WELFARE BENEFICIARIES WOULD BE HIT ALL SORTS OF
116.518290	118.104772	michelle_grattan SPECTRES THEY CAN RAISE
118.104772	120.698544	tony_abbott A TWO THOUSAND AND NINE VICTORIAN STUDY
120.874820	123.418228	tony_abbott DISCOVERED THAT IN THIS STATE ALONE

149.960324	150.967614	tony_abbott IT'S LIKELY
151.169072	153.410293	tony_abbott THAT A SIMILAR REGULATORY THICKET
153.536204	155.903336	tony_abbott WOULD BE DISCOVERED OPERATING AT COMMONWEALTH LEVEL
156.255887	158.220103	tony_abbott WITH SIMILAR POTENTIAL FOR PRUNING
158.547472	160.159137	tony_abbott AND FOR SAVINGS IT COSTS
160.511688	164.062386	tony_abbott TO BUSINESSES AND TAXPAYERS AND IN CITIZEN'S TIME
164.566031	168.947743	tim_lester MIGHT TONY ABBOTT BE PAINTING HIMSELF INTO A CORNER HERE WHERE
169.174384	174.160470	tim_lester ANY ANNOUNCEMENT NOW THAT INVOLVES ANY SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE
174.387110	176.905336	tim_lester FROM HIM IS GOING TO BE SEEN AS
177.157158	177.761532	tim_lester COUNTER
178.139266	180.279758	tim_lester TO THE POSITION THAT HE'S TRIED TO SET HIMSELF UP
180.279758	184.233372	michelle_grattan WELL THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT NOW HE'S LEFT HIMSELF A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM
184.434830	187.280424	michelle_grattan BUT HE CAN'T FALL OFF THE WAGON TOO OFTEN
187.532247	190.050472	michelle_grattan AND IF HE DOES START TO
190.478571	198.008065	michelle_grattan BRINGING FORWARD SPENDING PROPOSALS OR IF THE GOVERNMENT PUTS UP THINGS THAT THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO MATCH PEOPLE WILL SAY UH HUH WELL
198.184341	198.713168	michelle_grattan YOU SAID
198.839079	203.220791	michelle_grattan YOU WERE NOT GOING TO DO THIS SO HE'LL HAVE IN IN A WAY A DOUBLE PROBLEM OF CREDIBILITY
203.220791	204.857638	tony_abbott SECURING OUR FUTURE
205.109460	208.609794	tony_abbott DEPENDS MORE ON STRONG CITIZENS THAN ON BIG GOVERNMENT
209.088257	210.448098	tony_abbott THAT SUCCESS DEPENDS
210.699921	212.059763	tony_abbott UPON OUR INDUSTRY
212.286403	213.948432	tony_abbott NOT JUST ON OUR GEOGRAPHY
214.200254	217.146578	tony_abbott AND THAT OUT DESTINY WILL BE SECURED MORE BY HARD WORK
217.348036	218.254597	tony_abbott THAN BY GOOD LUCK

2.942526	8.291257	julia_gillard THERE HAS BEEN A LONG RUNNING DESTABILISATION CAMPAIGN HERE TO GET TO THIS POINT
8.494189	13.248616	julia_gillard WHERE KEVIN RUDD IS CLEARLY GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE WANTS TO SEEK THE LABOR LEADERSHIP
13.393568	20.075857	tim_lester HELLO EVERYONE UNTIL JUST TWENTY MONTHS AGO THEY WERE LABOR'S TWO TOP POLITICIANS PRIME MINISTER AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER
20.220809	23.772134	tim_lester NOW THEY ARE LOCKED IN AN ALL OUT WAR FOR THE TOP JOB
23.931582	27.106031	tim_lester DUELLING PRESS CONFERENCES THIS MORNING FROM KEVIN RUDD
27.236488	28.483076	tim_lester AND JULIA GILLARD
28.657018	31.208174	tim_lester THE PRIME MINISTER CALLING HERS TO CONFIRM
31.338631	33.875291	tim_lester THAT THERE WILL BE A LEADERSHIP VOTE IN CAUCUS
34.034739	35.411783	tim_lester TEN O'CLOCK MONDAY MORNING
35.643706	41.572245	julia_gillard WHEN THE BALLOT IS CALLED AT TEN AM ON MONDAY MORNING I WILL RENOMINATE FOR THE LABOR LEADERSHIP
41.920129	46.805013	julia_gillard AND I EXPECT TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUES WHEN I DO SO
47.239869	49.501121	julia_gillard BUT LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS
49.776530	55.197736	julia_gillard IF AGAINST MY EXPECTATION I DO NOT RECEIVE THE SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUES
55.458650	57.328531	julia_gillard THEN I WILL GO TO THE BACK BENCH
57.516969	61.575626	julia_gillard AND I WILL RENOUNCE ANY FURTHER AMBITION FOR THE LABOR LEADERSHIP
62.010482	65.416855	julia_gillard THIS WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NATION
65.895197	70.649624	julia_gillard I ANTICIPATE THAT MR RUDD WILL ALSO BE A CANDIDATE IN THIS BALLOT
70.910537	73.911044	julia_gillard I ASK HIM TO GIVE THE SAME UNDERTAKING
74.200948	79.578669	julia_gillard I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WIN THE NEXT ELECTION AND DEFEAT TONY ABBOTT
79.984535	83.724297	julia_gillard I BELIEVE I CAN LEAD LABOR TO THAT VICTORY
83.927230	86.608843	julia_gillard PROVIDED THAT THE LABOR PARTY UNITES
86.782785	88.725143	julia_gillard AND WE GET ON WITH THE JOB
88.913580	96.972914	tim_lester BUT MOST STRIKING IN WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAD TO SAY WAS THE WAY IN WHICH SHE JOINED THE SUCCESSION OF HER MINISTERS WHO'VE BEEN OUT IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR SO
97.146856	99.306641	tim_lester ATTACKING KEVIN RUDD PERSONALLY
99.466089	100.640200	tim_lester AND HIS RECORD
100.799647	102.133206	tim_lester HAVE A LISTEN IN PARTICULAR
102.292653	104.191525	tim_lester TO WHAT MS GILLARD HAD TO SAY
104.307487	107.018090	tim_lester ABOUT THE TWENTY TEN ELECTION CAMPAIGN
107.134052	109.656217	tim_lester AND LEAKS THAT DAMAGED LABOR AT THAT TIME
110.047588	113.048095	julia_gillard I DETERMINED THAT I WOULD CONTEST THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP
113.366989	117.077761	julia_gillard IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE GOVERNMENT THAT KEVIN RUDD HAD LEAD
117.295189	119.411489	julia_gillard HAD ENTERED A PERIOD OF PARALYSIS
119.831850	122.527958	julia_gillard KEVIN RUDD AS PRIME MINISTER ALWAYS HAD
122.759881	126.383682	julia_gillard UH VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY CHAOTIC WORK PATTERNS
126.601110	132.906524	julia_gillard IN MY VIEW KEVIN RUDD IS AN EXCELLENT CAMPAIGNER AND HE WAS AN EXCELLENT CAMPAIGNER IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
133.094962	136.530325	julia_gillard INDEED A REMARKABLE CAMPAIGNER IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
136.892705	139.197442	julia_gillard BUT GOVERNMENT REQUIRES DIFFERENT SKILLS
139.516337	143.067662	julia_gillard GOVERNMENT REQUIRES CONSISTENCY PURPOSE METHOD
143.212614	145.894227	julia_gillard DISCIPLINE INCLUSION CONSULTATION
146.082664	149.662980	julia_gillard IT REQUIRES YOU TO LEAD A BIG TEAM AND TO LEAD IT WELL
149.938388	153.040362	julia_gillard KEVIN RUDD AS PRIME MINISTER STRUGGLED TO DO THAT
153.156324	156.925077	tim_lester NOT THAT KEVIN RUDD HAS BEEN BACKWARD IN COMING FORWARD WITH CRITICISM EITHER
157.128010	161.925922	tim_lester HE ACCUSES THE GILLARD GOVERNMENT NOW OF SQUIBBING SOME OF THE KEY DECISIONS IN HEALTH
162.099865	164.042222	tim_lester AND VIEWING MANUFACTURING AS
164.201669	165.810637	tim_lester SOMEHOW OLD FASHIONED
166.288978	167.564556	kevin_rudd I HAVE SAID BEFORE
167.810975	171.507252	kevin_rudd FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST CONTESTED THE LEADERSHIP OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY
171.782661	175.131053	kevin_rudd THAT I NEVER WANTED TO BE PRIME MINISTER OF A COUNTRY WHICH DIDN'T MAKE THINGS ANY MORE
175.623890	177.943122	kevin_rudd THAT REMAINS MY ENDURING PASSION
178.291007	184.436974	kevin_rudd I DO NOT SHARE THE VIEW THAT MANUFACTURING IS SOME HOW OLD FASHIONED AND BELONGS TO THE OLD ECONOMY IT'S NEVER BEEN MY VIEW
184.714739	195.883537	tim_lester IT'S NOW VITAL FOR JULIA GILLARD THAT SHE MAKES THIS MONDAY VOTE A KIND OF FINAL ACT ON THIS LEADERSHIP FIGHT THAT SHE GETS TO A SITUATION WHERE IF MR RUDD LOSES ASSUMING HE CONTESTS IT
196.092517	200.899048	tim_lester THEN THERE ARE NO FOLLOW UP CHALLENGES OR CONTINUED DESTABILISATION
201.015147	206.750476	tim_lester HAVE A LISTEN TO HOW SHE TRIES TO DRAW MR RUDD INTO A COMMITMENT ON LEADERSHIP IN THAT REGARD
206.750476	208.329433	julia_gillard I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT
208.608073	213.298503	julia_gillard THAT THE LEADERSHIP BALLOT THAT IS ON MONDAY ENDS THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL
213.298503	215.620499	julia_gillard WHICH IS WHY I AM PREPARED TO SAY
215.806259	218.708753	julia_gillard THAT IF I AM NOT SUCCESSFUL IN THAT LEADERSHIP BALLOT
218.894512	223.561723	julia_gillard THEN I WILL GO TO THE BACK BENCH AND RENOUNCE AND FURTHER AMBITION TO THE LABOR LEADERSHIP
223.677823	224.862041	julia_gillard I EXPECT TO WIN
225.094240	228.693333	julia_gillard BUT IF AGAINST MY EXPECTATIONS I LOSE THAT IS MY COMMITMENT
228.902313	231.502948	julia_gillard KEVIN RUDD SHOULD GIVE A COMPARABLE COMMITMENT
231.619048	236.054059	tim_lester KEVIN RUDD FOR HIS PART ISN'T EVEN COMMITTED TO TAKE PART IN THE VOTE JUST YET
236.309478	243.414785	tim_lester HE'LL OBVIOUSLY COME BACK TO AUSTRALIA AND COUNT VOTES TO SEE WHETHER HE CAN MAKE AN IMPRESSIVE STAND AT MONDAYS VOTE
243.600544	246.735238	tim_lester OR WHETHER IT'S SIMPLY NOT WORTH HIS WHILE TO STAND AT THE MOMENT
246.967438	251.750748	tim_lester SO A COUPLE OF TENSE DAYS AHEAD AS KEVIN RUDD TRIES TO MOUNT THOSE NUMBERS
251.959728	254.212063	tim_lester AND LABOR PREPARES FOR A SHOW DOWN
254.351383	255.094422	tim_lester ON MONDAY

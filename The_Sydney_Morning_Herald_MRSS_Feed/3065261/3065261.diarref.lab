3.354369	9.380863	julia_gillard I HAVE DECIDED THAT AT TEN AM MONDAY MORNING A BALLOT FOR THE LABOR LEADERSHIP WILL BE CONDUCTED
9.693559	16.430724	julia_gillard FOLLOWING KEVIN RUDD'S RESIGNATION YESTERDAY I HAVE FORMED THIS VIEW THAT WE NEED A LEADERSHIP BALLOT
16.629712	20.325204	julia_gillard IN ORDER TO SETTLE THIS QUESTION ONCE AND FOR ALL
20.609472	30.672580	julia_gillard I BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE INTEREST OF THE LABOR PARTY THAT IT BE DETERMINED ONCE AND FOR ALL, BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY I BELIEVE IT IS THE INTEREST OF THE AUSTRALIAN NATION
31.127410	35.391439	julia_gillard FOR FAR TOO LONG WE HAVE SEEN SQUABBLING WITHIN THE LABOR PARTY
35.647281	39.769175	julia_gillard WHICH HAS OBSCURED THE GOVERNMENT'S ACHIEVEMENTS AND WHAT WE ARE DOING
39.911309	43.322532	julia_gillard TO BUILD A STRONGER AND FAIRER AUSTRALIA FOR THE FUTURE
43.692082	50.002844	julia_gillard IN RECENT DAYS I BELIEVE THIS MOVE TO A DISTRACTION FROM GOVERNING ITSELF
50.486101	57.166412	julia_gillard THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. AUSTRALIANS ARE RIGHTLY SICK OF THIS AND THEY WANT IT BROUGHT TO AN END
57.535962	62.624369	julia_gillard ONLY LABOR CAN PROVIDE THE VISION THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS FOR OUR FUTURE
62.823357	68.252887	julia_gillard AND LABOR CAN ONLY PROVIDE IT IF WE RESOLVE THIS ISSUE ONCE AND FOR ALL
68.423448	71.550403	julia_gillard AND PROCEED WITH UNITY AND DETERMINATION
72.062086	78.145434	julia_gillard WHEN THE BALLOT IS CALLED AT TEN AM ON MONDAY MORNING I WILL RENOMINATE FOR THE LABOR LEADERSHIP
78.344422	83.290695	julia_gillard AND I EXPECT TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUES WHEN I DO SO
83.688671	86.076528	julia_gillard BUT LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS
86.247089	91.705046	julia_gillard IF, AGAINST MY EXPECTATION, I DO NOT RECEIVE THE SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUES
91.875607	98.129516	julia_gillard THEN I WILL GO TO THE BACK BENCH AND I WILL RENOUNCE ANY FURTHER AMBITION FOR THE LABOR LEADERSHIP
98.442211	101.938715	julia_gillard THIS WOULD BE IN BEST INTERESTS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NATION
102.365118	107.140830	julia_gillard I ANTICIPATE THAT MR RUDD WILL ALSO BE A CANDIDATE IN THIS BALLOT
107.368245	110.438345	julia_gillard I ASK HIM TO GIVE THE SAME UNDERTAKING
110.694187	118.028317	julia_gillard THAT IF HE DOES NOT SUCCEED IN THIS BALLOT THAT HE WILL GO TO THE BACK BENCH AND RENOUNCE ANY FURTHER CLAIMS TO THE LEADERSHIP
118.397866	123.514700	julia_gillard AND ACT IN THE INTEREST OF THE AUSTRALIA LABOR PARTY AND OF OUR NATION

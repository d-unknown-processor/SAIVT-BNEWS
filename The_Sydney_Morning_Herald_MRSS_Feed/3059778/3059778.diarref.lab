15.218417	20.954590	michelle_grattan WELL I THINK IT WAS COMPLETELY THE LABOR PARTY UNPLUGGED, THE LABOR ABSOLUTELY AT ITS WORST
21.227741	22.554475	michelle_grattan I THINK THAT UH
23.178820	34.573122	michelle_grattan REALLY NOW IT HAS BLOWN UP THE SITUATION TO SUCH A POINT THAT IT HAS TO BE RESOLVED. IT HAS TO BE RESOLVED QUICKLY. OF. AND THAT MEANS A VOTE. OF COURSE NO ONE KNOWS WHETHER A VOTE
34.846273	35.782791	michelle_grattan WOULD IN FACT
36.094964	44.952863	michelle_grattan LEAD TO UH AN END OF IT OR WHETHER IT WOULD LEAD TO ANOTHER BOUT OF INSTABILITY BUT NEVERTHELESS THAT HAS TO COME THAT VOTE
50.103712	77.087137	michelle_grattan NO, BECAUSE I THINK NOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS OPEN WARFARE IN THE PARTY. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE RUDD CAMP IS ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO HAVE A GO. IT'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER THAT'S SOONER OR LATER. THEY'VE BEEN UH PUTTING IT OFF A BIT TIL THEY GARNER MORE NUMBERS. BUT THE THE CONTEST IS ON. IT'S GAME ON. IT HAS TO HAPPEN AT SOME POINT THAT THE CAUCUS GETS A SAY AND RESOLVES THIS
82.491626	91.505612	michelle_grattan WELL IT'S POSSIBLE. UH AT THE MOMENT EACH SIDE IS STARING THE OTHER DOWN. THE RUDD FORCES DON'T WANT TO BE THE FIRST TO MOVE. THE GILLARD FORCES DON'T WANT TO BE FIRST TO MOVE
91.739741	94.081036	michelle_grattan MAYBE SOME OTHER
94.315165	94.783424	michelle_grattan UH
95.212662	120.849842	michelle_grattan PLAYERS IN CAUCUS WILL SAY ENOUGH, LET'S BRING THIS ON. IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW IT WILL COME ON, BUT ONE WOULD HAVE TO THINK THAT IT'S GOT TO COME ON VERY SOON. IT'S QUITE INTERESTING INCIDENTALLY JUST AS A SIDELINE TO ALL OF THIS TIM, THAT ANNA BLIGH IN QUEENSLAND, WHO OF COURSE IS FACING HER OWN UH POSSIBLE UH ANNIHILATION UH UH AND CERTAINLY UH A SERIOUS LOSS FOR LABOR 
121.357122	138.897324	michelle_grattan IS CALLING FOR A QUICK BALLOT. NOW ANNA BLIGH IS VERY CLOSE TO KEVIN RUDD. I THINK UH WHAT SHE IS REALLY SAYING ALTHOUGH SHE IS NOT DECLARING IT IN THESE TERMS IS THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A RUDD PRIME MINISTERSHIP BE BEFORE THE QUEENSLAND ELECTION ON MARCH TWENTY FOUR
143.950619	151.169612	michelle_grattan I THINK THAT UH HER CALCULATION WOULD BE THAT KEVIN RUDD IS POPULAR IN QUEENSLAND, OF COURSE HE'S BEEN DOING QUITE A BIT OF CAMPAIGNING
151.481784	168.807367	michelle_grattan IN QUEENSLAND. HE WAS UH THERE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. AND SHE WOULD THINK THAT HE MIGHT BOOST THE LABOR VOTE BY A LITTLE BIT. NOW HE'S NOT GOING TO SAVE THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT, BUT ANY ANYTHING HELPS IN THIS SITUATION 
174.543540	189.683914	michelle_grattan WELL, I THINK IT IS MORE LIKELY TO BE RELEASE BY ANTI RUDD PEOPLE, BUT UH CERTAINLY THE GILLARD CAMP THINKS IT WAS RELEASED BY RUDD PEOPLE. IF IT WAS RELEASED BY ANTI RUDD PEOPLE WELL THEN IT WAS TO REMIND CAUCUS MEMBERS
190.230216	193.898245	michelle_grattan UH, OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO TRIGGER ALL THAT
194.210417	213.409036	michelle_grattan NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION, BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BACKFIRED, BECAUSE IN FACT IT GAVE KEVIN RUDD THE OPPORTUNITY IN HIS LATE NIGHT APPEARANCE TO SAY HE'D CHANGED. THAT UH HE'S LESS FRENETIC THAN HE USED TO BE, EVEN THOUGH HE'S PRETTY FRENETIC GETTING ONTO TELEVISION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, BUT ANYWAY
218.442820	226.247137	michelle_grattan IT WORKED PRETTY WELL FOR RUDD, BUT DID IT WORK AMONG CAUCUS MEMBERS. THAT'S THE POINT. DO THEY REALLY THINK KEVIN RUDD HAS CHANGED.
226.559309	232.295482	michelle_grattan I DON'T THINK KEVIN RUDD'S CHANGED A LOT, AND EVEN HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE PUSHING THE CASE
232.724719	240.411971	michelle_grattan REALLY HARD, HE WASN'T SAYING HE TRANSFORMED. BUT HE WAS SAYING I'VE LEARNT, I'VE CHANGED IN SOME WAYS
240.919252	243.767827	michelle_grattan UH BUT, I THINK THAT UH
244.040978	255.220662	michelle_grattan IF IT WAS RELEASED BY THE RUDD FORCES, THEN IT WAS OBVIOUSLY TO GET THAT MESSAGE OUT, BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FEW A PRETTY HIGH RISK EXERCISE. A VERY DARING PLAY
260.469065	264.527309	michelle_grattan I THINK THAT UH KEVIN RUDD WOULD GIVE LABOR SOME BOUNCE
264.761439	285.716029	michelle_grattan UH BUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD SEE IT AS SORT OF RECTIFYING A SITUATION. THE PUBLIC LIKE HIM MORE THAN THEY LIKE JULIA GILLARD. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. THEY WARM TO HIM MORE WHATEVER HIS FAILINGS AND WHATEVER MANY IN THE CAUCUS THINK. HOWEVER I ALSO THINK THAT HE WOULD HAVE
285.989180	296.095770	michelle_grattan CONSIDERABLE INTERNAL PROBLEMS IN THE PARTY BECAUSE UH THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF BRUISED AND ANGRY PEOPLE AND THE THE CAUCUS HAS JUST BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH
296.407942	343.546014	michelle_grattan THE FRONT BENCH UH THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF ANGST THERE, PEOPLE WOULD GO TO THE BACK BENCH. THERE THERE'D BE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF WAYNE SWAN AND WHAT YOU DO ABOUT THE DEPUTY. AND ALL THESE THINGS. BUT OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. EVEN THOUGH THEY LIKE RUDD MORE, I WOULD THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY WELL, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, REALLY, THE LABOR PARTY CAN'T GOVERN ITSELF. AND THE OLD ADAGE THEREFORE IT CAN'T GOVERN THE COUNTRY. I THINK PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THE HUNG PARLIAMENT. THEY ARE SICK OF ALL THIS INTRIGUE. AND THEREFORE WHEN THEIR CHANCE TO VOTE CAME, THEY WOULD SAY, WELL LET'S THROW OUT THIS LOT. I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THAT, I THINK RUDD WOULD SAVE MORE OF THE FURNITURE, BUT WOULDN'T SAVE THE LABOR PARTY FROM DEFEAT WHENEVER THE NEXT ELECTION IS

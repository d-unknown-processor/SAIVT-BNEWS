5.717884	11.730153	lenore_taylor MALCOLM TURNBULL OF COURSE HAD BEEN THE BLOKE THAT ALWAYS DID WHAT HE WANTED TO DO HE CRASHED THROUGH OR HE CRASHED
12.160410	16.915878	lenore_taylor HE'D TAKEN THE LEAD IN THE AUSTRALIAN REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL
17.097038	21.875151	lenore_taylor HE'D ENTERED POLITICS SKY ROCKETED STRAIGHT INTO THE MINISTRY AND SOON AFTER
22.124247	35.552782	lenore_taylor THE ELECTION LOST AFTER BRENDAN NELSON'S BRIEF TURN AS LEADER HE BECAME LIBERAL LEADER ALMOST THROUGH SHEAR DINT OF PERSONALITY THEY USED TO REFER TO IT AS THE TURNBULL EXPERIMENT WHICH WAS ALMOST AN INEVITABILITY
35.869813	40.330894	lenore_taylor BUT THEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IT ALL CAME TO A BITTER CRASHING END
40.715861	46.807388	lenore_taylor HE TOOK ON THE PARTY'S VIEWS ON CLIMATE CHANGE HE STUCK TO HIS PRINCIPLES AND HE LOST HIS JOB AS A RESULT
47.147065	53.714139	lenore_taylor THAT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR MALCOLM TURNBULL OBVIOUSLY IT WAS AN UNACCUSTOMED EXPERIENCE OF FAILURE
54.031170	61.277597	lenore_taylor HE FELT HE WAS STANDING UP FOR PRINCIPLE AND FOR THE POLICY THAT HIS PARTY HAD TAKEN TO THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN ELECTION CAMPAIGN
61.390823	67.346480	lenore_taylor BUT IN THE END HE STOOD ALMOST ALONE IN THE CHAMBER TO ADVOCATE THAT POLICY
67.482350	71.875496	lenore_taylor AND HE HAD THE VERY BITTER EXPERIENCE OF SEEING THAT TONY ABBOTT'S POSITION
72.101947	79.303084	lenore_taylor ON THE ISSUE TONY ABBOTT WHO OF COURSE ONCE FAMOUSLY SAID THAT THE SETTLED SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE WAS ABSOLUTE CRAP
79.552180	83.990616	lenore_taylor WAS IN FACT POPULAR WITH THE VOTERS AND TONY ABBOTT ROCKETED AHEAD IN THE POLLS
84.217067	89.697177	lenore_taylor FOR A WHILE THERE HE ACTUALLY CONSIDERED LEAVING POLITICS ALTOGETHER HE IN FACT ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION
89.878338	94.611161	lenore_taylor AND THEN THE MINUTE HE ANNOUNCED IT HE REALISED THAT HE'D MAD A MISTAKE THAT HE WANTED TO STAY IN PUBLIC LIFE
94.882902	101.880233	lenore_taylor MALCOLM TURNBULL SAYS HE'S COME THROUGH ALL OF THIS A STRONGER MAN HIS WIFE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY HE WAS NOW ZEN ALTHOUGH
102.061393	104.642933	lenore_taylor A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE FIND THAT'S GOING A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR
104.869384	111.798779	lenore_taylor MALCOLM TURNBULL IS A BLOKE WHO'S ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE NEXT BIG THING SOME OF HIS FRIENDS REFERRED TO IT AS MERCHANT BANKERS DISEASE AND OF COURSE HE WAS
112.025230	114.787930	lenore_taylor PRIOR TO HIS POLITICAL LIFE A MERCHANT BANKER FOR A WHILE
115.263477	127.967369	lenore_taylor IT SEEMS NOW THAT THE NEXT BIG THINGS THAT HE LOOKS FOR ALONG THE WAY ARE BIG IDEAS AND HE ADVANCES THEM IN SPEECHES AND CONTRIBUTIONS AND HE HAS THE LICENSE TO DO THAT EVEN OUTSIDE HIS PORTFOLIO AREA AS A FORMER LEADER SO
128.148530	131.318842	lenore_taylor HE TALKS ABOUT HOW AUSTRALIA SHOULD DEAL WITH THE RISE OF CHINA
131.522647	137.115983	lenore_taylor HE TALKS ABOUT WHAT A GOOD IDEA IT WOULD BE SHOULD WE PUT SOME OF THE PROFITS FROM THE MINING BOON INTO A SOVEREIGN
137.297809	137.979131	lenore_taylor WEALTH FUND
138.384108	151.586192	lenore_taylor HE'S TRYING TO USE THOSE BIG IDEAS I THINK ALSO TO DIFFERENTIATE HIMSELF FROM THE CURRENT STATE OF THE POLITICAL DEBATE ABOUT WHICH HE'S QUITE FRANKLY DISMAYED HE SAYS IT'S TOXIC AND IT'S NASTY AND IT'S FULL OF THOUGHT BUBBLES
151.857933	158.334427	lenore_taylor HE NEVER MENTIONED OR CRITICISED TONY ABBOTT IN THAT REGARD BUT YOU KNOW THE CONTRAST IS THERE FOR READERS TO DRAW SHOULD THEY WANT TO DO SO
158.560878	164.561825	lenore_taylor IT WAS INTERESTING TO TALK TO SOCIAL RESEARCHERS AND POLLSTERS ABOUT THIS PHENOMENON ABOUT MALCOLM TURNBULL
164.697695	167.981233	lenore_taylor IN CONTRAST TO THE TONE OF THE CURRENT POLITICAL DEBATE
168.162393	174.435082	lenore_taylor AND BOTH HUGH MACKAY WHO'S BEEN A LONG TIME RESEARCHER INTO THE MIND AND MOOD OF THE AUSTRALIAN NATURE NATION
174.661532	185.531173	lenore_taylor AND JOHN STIRTON WHO'S THE HEAD POLLSTER FOR NIELSON POLLS THEY'VE BOTH SAID THAT IN A WAY TURNBULL WAS ALMOST THE PERFECT POLITICIAN FOR THE TIMES ALMOST THE PERFECT ANTIDOTE TO THE UM
185.893494	191.124508	lenore_taylor THE NASTINESS AND THE TOXICITY AND THE AND THE DOWN AND DIRTY OF THE CURRENT DEBATE
191.305669	193.094631	lenore_taylor UNFORTUNATELY FOR MALCOLM TURNBULL
193.275791	195.562945	lenore_taylor HIS OWN COLLEAGUES AREN'T SEEING HIM THAT WAY AT THE MOMENT

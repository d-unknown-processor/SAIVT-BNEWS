4.857410	7.458475	kevin_rudd CAN I SAY MORE BROADLY ON THE QUESTION OF UM
7.803194	11.062360	kevin_rudd OF PERSONAL ATTACKS I JUST EMPHASISE AGAIN WHAT I SAID BEFORE
11.313065	13.412719	kevin_rudd WHATEVER OUR DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWS
13.882791	14.822935	kevin_rudd WHATEVER THEY ARE
15.104978	15.669065	kevin_rudd YOU KNOW
16.264489	18.270129	kevin_rudd ACROSS THE AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL LANDSCAPE
18.552173	20.025065	kevin_rudd THERE IS A PLACE FOR CIVILITY
20.369784	22.218734	david_marr RUDD'S CALLING THESE UM
22.720144	24.788460	david_marr CHARACTER ASSESSMENTS UM
24.976489	26.606072	david_marr TERRIBLE PERSONAL ATTACKS
26.762763	30.303971	david_marr A NEW LOW IN AUSTRALIAN POLITICS ETCETERA ETCETERA AN END TO CIVILITY
30.805381	38.921957	david_marr BUT REALLY THIS IS THE LABOR LEADERSHIP EXPLAINING FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT HAD BEEN DECISIVE IN HIS DOWNFALL
39.486043	44.844863	david_marr AND THINK HOW DIFFERENT THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE NOW
45.126906	48.072691	david_marr IF SUCH CANDID EXPLANATIONS HAD BEEN GIVEN
48.480086	51.989957	david_marr IN TWENTY TEN AT THE TIME OF HIS EXECUTION
52.272000	56.471309	david_marr THAT RUDD HAD TO BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE BECAUSE HE COULDN'T HACK IT
56.941381	58.132230	david_marr THAT HE COULDN'T DO IT
58.445612	61.297381	david_marr THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT HIM
61.610763	63.240345	david_marr UM THAT MADE HIM
63.647741	67.063597	david_marr UNFIT TO BE PRIME MINISTER NOW NONE OF THAT WAS SAID
67.345640	69.852691	david_marr THE COLLECTIVE FAILURE OF THE PARTY
70.228748	74.584748	david_marr FROM THE TIME OF THE GREAT VICTORY IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
74.772777	77.624547	david_marr TO RUDD'S EXECUTION IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
78.063281	78.502014	david_marr TO
78.721381	82.858014	david_marr ACTUALLY HELP THIS MAN AND HELP THE GOVERNMENT AND GET THINGS ON TRACK
83.234072	86.618590	david_marr REMAINS A BEWILDERING FAILURE OF THE PARTY
87.057324	89.564374	simon_crean AND THIS IS THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF KEVIN
89.909094	92.071424	simon_crean ALWAYS HAVING TO HAVE AN EVENT
92.384806	93.481640	simon_crean FOR THE DAY
94.609813	97.148201	simon_crean BUT YOU ALWAYS WONDER WHERE THE STRATEGY IS GOING TO LEAD
97.649612	103.791885	david_marr THE ATTACKS ON RUDD THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING IN THE LAST THIRTY SIX HOURS ARE PERSONAL BUT
104.324633	107.709151	david_marr IN THIS CASE THE POLITICAL IS PERSONAL
107.865842	109.150705	david_marr DEEPLY PERSONAL
109.934158	111.438388	david_marr BECAUSE THE PROBLEM
111.751770	113.976777	david_marr WITH THE RUDD GOVERNMENT
114.321496	116.859885	david_marr NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM BY ANY MEANS, BUT
117.141928	120.150388	david_marr THE KIND OF PROBLEM AT THE CORE OF THE RUDD GOVERNMENT
120.401094	124.036317	david_marr WAS A PERSONAL PROBLEM IT WAS ABOUT KEVIN RUDD'S CHARACTER
124.631741	125.509209	david_marr HE HAD
126.261324	129.113094	david_marr GREAT PERSONAL RELUCTANCE
129.551827	130.930705	david_marr TO SHARE POWER
131.745496	133.124374	david_marr AND YOU CAN'T RUN
133.312403	135.286705	david_marr A BIG NATION LIKE AUSTRALIA
135.443396	137.574388	david_marr A BIG DEMOCRATIC NATION LIKE AUSTRALIA
137.731079	138.984604	david_marr UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING
139.141295	141.961727	david_marr TO SHARE MUCH MORE THAN HE WAS WILLING TO SHARE
142.525813	143.810676	david_marr THE BUSINESS OF POWER
144.249410	152.365986	david_marr RUDD USED THE RELEASE OF THAT NOT VERY INFLAMMATORY VIDEO THE OTHER DAY OF HIM SWEARING AT HIS OWN DIFFICULTIES IN SPEAKING MANDARIN
152.710705	156.126561	david_marr TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE THAT HE WAS
156.377266	158.288892	david_marr TO SOME EXTENT A CHANGED MAN
158.758964	167.000892	david_marr MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE PROMISES OF CHANGE WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IN THAT STATEMENT THAT HE DID UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEMS WERE
167.596317	169.476604	david_marr AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER
169.884000	176.245640	david_marr WHAT HE'S GONE THROUGH IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS TAUGHT HIM HOW TO BE A PRIME MINISTER
178.031914	180.382273	david_marr I'VE GOT MY DOUBTS BECAUSE
180.570302	183.453410	david_marr IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE FAULTS THAT HE DISPLAYED
183.610101	184.800950	david_marr BACK THEN
185.239683	190.191108	david_marr ALONG WITH GREAT VIRTUES. I'M NOT RUNNING THIS MAN DOWN ENTIRELY BY ANY MEANS
190.567165	192.384777	david_marr BUT THE FAULTS HE DISPLAYED
192.510129	194.359079	david_marr SEEM TO BE PROFOUND
194.703799	195.455914	david_marr AND
195.988662	197.116835	david_marr THE EFFORTS
197.367540	200.093957	david_marr UM TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT
200.877410	202.726360	david_marr DID REACH A POINT
202.851712	206.142216	david_marr AS JULIA GILLARD SAID THIS MORNING OF PARALYSIS
206.455597	210.310187	david_marr AND THAT CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. NOW WHETHER HE WOULD BE THE SAME FIGURE AGAIN
211.187655	215.543655	david_marr I DON'T KNOW. BUT HE'S NOT CLAIMING HIMSELF TO BE TRANSFORMED
215.825698	221.247194	david_marr NOT CLAIMING IN VERY RUDDIAN WAY NOT CLAIMING TO BE MOTHER THERESA ON THIS
221.497899	222.281353	david_marr UM
222.469381	223.942273	david_marr HE IS CLAIMING
224.130302	226.292633	david_marr SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT
226.668691	230.554619	david_marr CAREFULLY MUFFLED FROM THE PUBLIC BEHIND THAT CHEERFUL EXTERIOR
230.742647	235.537381	david_marr IS THE DEEP ANGER THAT DRIVES RUDD. WOUNDS THAT GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO CHILDHOOD
235.788086	243.904662	david_marr BUT IN THIS CASE WOUNDS THAT DON'T GO FAR BACK AND ARE MUCH RAWER AND THEY'RE THE WOUNDS OF TWENTY TEN, THE WOUNDS OF HIM BEING CHUCKED OUT OF OFFICE
244.218043	247.727914	david_marr NOW HE'S A MAN OF ENERGY AND INTELLIGENCE
247.915942	252.021237	david_marr AND EXTRAORDINARY NIMBLENESS OUT THERE IN THE ELECTORATE
252.804691	255.969842	david_marr BUT IT IS STILL MY VIEW THAT WHAT DRIVES HIM
256.126532	257.160691	david_marr IS THIS
257.568086	260.325842	david_marr POWERFUL FURNACE IN HIM
260.482532	270.980806	david_marr OF RAGE THAT UM ALL OF THESE TERRIBLE THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE TO HIM THE WISH TO PROVE HIMSELF THE WISH TO REGAIN POWER AND THE WISH TO BE THE PRIME MINISTER
271.200173	273.237151	david_marr THAT HE BELIEVES HE CAN BE

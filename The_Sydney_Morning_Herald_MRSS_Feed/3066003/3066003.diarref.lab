4.042916	5.090177	kevin_rudd I DO NOT BELIEVE
5.504211	7.014216	kevin_rudd THAT UH PRIME MINISTER GILLARD
7.257765	9.425353	kevin_rudd CAN LEAD THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY
9.547127	10.935357	kevin_rudd TO SUCCESS IN THE NEXT ELECTION
10.935357	15.684566	julia_gillard KEVIN RUDD IS CLEARLY GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE WANTS TO SEEK THE LABOR LEADERSHIP
15.781986	22.430878	andy_park AND THUS BEGINS THE HORSE TRADING THE BET HEDGING AND THE STRIDENT DISPLAYS OF LOYALTY AHEAD OF MONDAYS CAUCUS VOTE
22.650072	27.496700	andy_park AND FOR NOW IT SEEMS THE PRO GILLARD CAMP IS MOST VOCAL ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE FRONT BENCHERS
27.496700	33.731559	andy_park AFTER BOTH JULIA GILLARD AND KEVIN RUDD ADDRESSED THE MEDIA TODAY MINISTERS HAVE COME OUT IN SUPPORT OF THE PRIME MINISTER
33.731559	45.348854	nicola_roxon THE PRIME MINISTER HAS EXTREMELY STRONG SUPPORT UH WITHIN THE CAUCUS AND WITHIN THE CABINET BUT ULTIMATELY WE'RE A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THERE WILL BE A VOTE I FULLY EXPECT THAT JULIA WILL WIN THAT VOTE
45.568048	49.659674	nicola_roxon AND I THINK THAT THE MESSAGE EITHER WAY WHETHER IT'S JULIA OR KEVIN
49.781448	52.533554	nicola_roxon IS THAT THEN THE SPECULATION MUST STOP
52.898878	60.107933	stephen_conroy UH LOOK I'M SUPPORTING THE PRIME MINISTER UH IT'S A BALLOT YOU'LL SEE LOTS OF PEOPLE EXPRESSING THEIR VIEWS OVER THE NEXT UH FEW DAYS AND THAT'S AS IT SHOULD BE
60.302772	62.713909	jenny_macklin MY SUPPORT ON MONDAY WILL BE
62.811329	64.930206	jenny_macklin VERY STRONGLY WITH THE PRIME MINISTER
65.051981	69.557640	jenny_macklin I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED
70.093448	74.038945	martin_ferguson I'M NOT SURE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE A LEADERSHIP BALLOT ON MONDAY
74.769592	77.887022	martin_ferguson BUT CAN I SAY THAT UH SHOULD KEVIN RUDD CHOOSE TO WIN
78.617669	82.124777	martin_ferguson THEN I WILL VOTE FOR KEVIN RUDD AS THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA
82.124777	84.560269	andy_park FOR NOW THOUGH THE RUDD CAMP IS TYPICALLY QUIET
84.730753	91.379645	andy_park BUT WITH A WEEKEND AHEAD OF FRANTIC BACK ROOM TALKS THE COMMON CONSENSUS IS A WEARINESS OF THE CONSTANT LEADERSHIP BATTLE
91.379645	95.763530	stephen_conroy OH WELL I'M SURE THERE'LL BE MANY MANY PHONE CALLS FLYING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS MANY PEOPLE SPEAKING OUT
96.104499	98.588700	stephen_conroy ABOUT WHO THEY SUPPORT UH AND THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE
98.807894	99.660317	stephen_conroy WHAT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH
100.001285	101.438225	stephen_conroy IS AFTER WE GET PAST MONDAY
101.876614	103.459683	stephen_conroy THAT THE LOSER ACCEPTS
103.873717	104.726139	stephen_conroy THE OUTCOME

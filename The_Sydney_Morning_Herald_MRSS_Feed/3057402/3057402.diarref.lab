4.548758	21.175252	judith_ireland LOOK AT A SCHOOL LIKE BLUE GUM IN CANBERRA'S NORTHERN SUBURBS AND YOU QUICKLY SEE WHY SO MANY WANT A NEW WAY OF SHARING THE EDUCATION DOLLAR SCATTERED AROUND IT'S WORN CLASSROOMS ARE SECOND HAND COUCHES, ANT FARMS AND CROCHETED RUGS DREAM CATCHERS AND WIND CHIMES SWING IN THE BREEZE 
21.802667	27.919962	judith_ireland SCHOOLS LIKE BLUE GUM ALL ACROSS AUSTRALIA ARE LOOKING TO THE GONSKI REVIEW FOR AN HISTORIC FUNDING SHAKE UP
28.233669	36.076355	maureen_hartung WELL WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT THE GONSKI REVIEW WILL RADICALLY CHANGE THE WAY SCHOOLING IS VIEWED IN AUSTRALIA
36.233209	37.331185	julia_gillard THAT REPORT
37.331185	51.448019	judith_ireland DAVID GONSKI'S TWO YEAR REVIEW FINDS THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM NEEDS AT LEAST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS MORE EACH YEAR THAT THERE IS A WORRYING GAP BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW PERFORMING SCHOOL STUDENTS AND THAT AUSTRALIA'S EDUCATION STANDARD INTERNATIONALLY IS SLIPPING
51.448019	60.859242	david_gonski AUSTRALIA'S SCHOOLING PERFORMANCE HAS SLIPPED OVER THE PAST DECADE AND IS AT SERIOUS RISK IN OUR OPINION OF CONTINUING TO SLIDE FURTHER
61.172950	73.407540	julia_gillard IN THE PAST TEN YEARS WE'VE SLIPPED FROM BEING EQUAL SECOND IN READING INTERNATIONALLY TO EQUAL SEVENTH AND FROM BEING EQUAL FIFTH IN MATHS TO EQUAL THIRTEENTH
73.564393	82.505055	judith_ireland PARENTS OF BLUE GUM STUDENTS PAY BETWEEN FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO THE SECULAR AND PROGRESSIVE SMALL SCHOOL
82.975616	93.798523	judith_ireland BUT MISS HARTUNG SAYS THE CURRENT QUIRKS OF AUSTRALIA'S EDUCATION FUNDING MODEL MEANS HER SCHOOL GETS LESS FEDERAL FUNDING PER STUDENT THAN SOME ELITE SCHOOLS LIKE KINGS COLLEGE
94.112230	112.150408	maureen_hartung THE CURRENT S E S MODEL FOR FUNDING SCHOOLS THE SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS MODEL UM IS SERIOUSLY FLAWED UM IT'S THAT'S EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT I THINK THAT THERE'S ONLY OUR SCHOOL AND MAYBE ONE OTHER IN THE A C T THAT ARE ACTUALLY FUNDED ACCORDING TO THEIR S E S SCORE
112.464115	135.521612	maureen_hartung IT LOOKS AT UM THE AVERAGE OF THE INCOME THE OCCUPATION AND THE EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF THE TWO HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS AROUND EACH OF OUR FAMILIES SO IT'S AKIN TO DETERMINING AGE PENSION BY THE AVERAGE OF THE UM AGES OF THE PEOPLE IN A STREET. IT'S QUITE NONSENSICAL 
135.521612	149.011031	julia_gillard SO STANDING STILL WITH TODAY'S EDUCATION SYSTEM MEANS WE WILL FALL FURTHER AND FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND THE STANDARDS OF THE WORLD BECAUSE OTHER NATIONS ARE NOT STANDING STILL
149.481592	159.990791	judith_ireland BUT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS RETURNING THE BUDGET TO SURPLUS IS A MORE URGENT PRIORITY THAN ADDRESSING THE STRUCTURAL DISADVANTAGE IN AUSTRALIAN SCHOOLS WHICH IS LEADING TO FALLING STUDENT PERFORMANCES
160.618206	170.186283	judith_ireland IN IT'S INITIAL RESPONSE TO THE REPORT THE GOVERNMENT ADDS THAT IT NEEDS MORE TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE GONSKI PROPOSALS AND TO CONSULT WITH THE COMMUNITY AND STATE GOVERNMENTS

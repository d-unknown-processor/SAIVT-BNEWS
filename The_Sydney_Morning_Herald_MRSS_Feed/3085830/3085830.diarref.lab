8.503597	10.635165	jenny_macklin IT'S BEEN GOING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR NOW
10.714532	12.279194	kevin_andrews WE CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT WE'VE GOT
12.653353	14.149986	tim_lester HOW MUCH SHOULD OUR GOVERNMENT
14.218014	16.406273	tim_lester PAY COUPLES TO LEAVE WORK
16.599022	17.472058	tim_lester AND HAVE A BABY
17.993612	20.930187	tim_lester WELL THE ISSUE IS VERY MUCH ALIVE HERE IN FEDERAL PARLIAMENT
21.236317	25.261353	tim_lester WITH REPORTS THAT THIS WEEKS CLOSED COALITION PARTY ROOM MEETING
25.703540	29.966676	tim_lester INCLUDED SOME CONCERNS FROM OPPOSITION MPS THAT THEIR SCHEME
30.261468	31.962187	tim_lester IS SIMPLY TOO GENEROUS
32.290993	35.148201	kevin_andrews NO NO LOOK UH UH THAT WAS UH SOMEWHAT UM
35.511022	38.232173	kevin_andrews ADVENTUROUS REPORTING IF I COULD PUT IT THAT WAY TIM
38.458935	42.563338	tim_lester LABOR PUT IN PLACE AUSTRALIA'S FIRST PAID PARENTAL LEAVE SCHEME
42.880806	46.849151	tim_lester IN LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES
47.053237	48.708604	tim_lester HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE
48.821986	49.865094	tim_lester TIME OFF WORK
49.977605	51.370802	tim_lester ON THE MINIMUM WAGE
51.579782	53.170349	tim_lester WHILE THEY PARENT THEIR NEWBORN
53.324626	55.762721	tim_lester AND DO IT FOR UP TO EIGHTEEN WEEKS
56.250340	57.689977	tim_lester BUT THE COALITION OFFERING
57.817687	59.605624	tim_lester IS IN FACT FAR MORE GENEROUS
60.197732	63.135057	kevin_andrews IT'S TWENTY SIX WEEKS VERSUS EIGHTEEN WEEKS CURRENTLY
63.460136	68.092517	kevin_andrews IT'S AT A FULL REPLACEMENT WAGE UP TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS VERSUS THE MINIMUM WAGE
68.440816	69.566984	kevin_andrews AND IT INCLUDES
69.810794	72.724898	kevin_andrews AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT THAT THE CURRENT SCHEME DOESN'T INCLUDE
72.933878	74.152925	kevin_andrews AND THAT'S SUPERANNUATION
74.454785	76.567800	jenny_macklin A ROLLS ROYCE SCHEME FOR
76.800000	78.750476	jenny_macklin MOTHERS UH WHO ARE EARNING
79.156825	84.532245	jenny_macklin HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVEN A MOTHER WHO WAS EARNING A MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GET
84.834104	87.864308	jenny_macklin SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM MR ABBOTT
88.189388	91.300862	jenny_macklin AND UH OF COURSE THE TAXPAYER TO HAVE A BABY
91.416961	93.773787	kevin_andrews ON ANY OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT
94.110476	97.663129	kevin_andrews WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS MORE GENEROUS THAT WHAT EXISTS AT THE PRESENT TIME
97.837279	99.091156	tim_lester AND THEREFORE MORE COSTLY
99.857415	102.562540	kevin_andrews WELL IT'S A COST WHICH WE BELIEVE CAN BE MET
102.899229	107.461950	tim_lester THE COALITION WOULD PUT A NEW LEVY ON AUSTRALIA'S THREE THOUSANDTH BIGGEST COMPANIES
107.624490	111.966621	tim_lester TO PAY THE EXTRA THREE TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THEIR SCHEME WOULD COST
112.454240	119.269297	tim_lester SO WHY WOULD COALITION MPS BE WORRIED GIVEN THEIR PARENTAL LEAVE SCHEME IS CLEARLY MORE ATTRACTIVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
119.571156	123.495329	tim_lester WELL APPARENTLY SOME COALITION MPS ARE HAVING TROUBLE EXPLAINING TO VOTERS
123.704308	125.666395	tim_lester HOW IT IS THEY CAN BE SO COMMITTED
125.863764	128.290249	tim_lester TO SUCH AN EXPENSIVE PARENTAL LEAVE SCHEME
128.650159	133.468299	tim_lester WHEN THEY HAVEN'T WORKED OUT YET WHETHER THEY'RE EVEN GOING TO PAY FOR SOME OTHER PRIORITIES
133.723719	137.055782	jenny_macklin IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT MR MR ABBOTT
137.299592	142.036463	jenny_macklin WANTS TO SPEND MONEY TAX PAYERS MONEY ON PAYING VERY WEALTHY MOTHERS
142.373152	145.008617	jenny_macklin SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HAVE A BABY
145.275646	148.944399	jenny_macklin INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING A NATIONAL DISABILITY INSURANCE SCHEME
149.002449	153.623220	tim_lester IN FACT BOTH MAJOR PARTIES SAY THEY SUPPORT NATIONAL DISABILITY INSURANCE
154.006349	154.819048	tim_lester PROBLEM IS
154.958367	158.545850	tim_lester NEITHER HAS COME UP WITH AN EXPLANATION FOR HOW THEY'LL PAY FOR IT
158.824490	160.287347	kevin_andrews THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT SAID YET
160.531156	162.191383	kevin_andrews AND IT HASN'T PUT A CENT INTO IT YET
162.365533	163.224671	kevin_andrews AND IT HASN'T SAID
163.410431	170.898866	kevin_andrews WHEN IT'S GOING TO PUT MONEY INTO IT AND HOW MUCH MONEY IT'S GOING TO PUT INTO IT SO FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WHEN WE'RE NOT EVEN IN GOVERNMENT
171.212336	176.134966	kevin_andrews UH AND FOR THEM SIMPLY TO RE ANNOUNCE THEIR INTENTION TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THE SCHEME
176.309116	177.690703	kevin_andrews IS SOMEWHAT DISINGENUOUS
177.783583	185.248798	tim_lester BUT YOU WOULD SUPPORT NATIONAL DISABILITY INSURANCE UNDER AN ABBOTT LEAD GOVERNMENT THERE WOULD BE A NATIONAL DISABILITY INSURANCE SCHEME
184.145850	186.641995	kevin_andrews YEH THERE WOULD BE WE'VE MADE THAT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR
186.990295	187.547574	kevin_andrews WE ARE
187.768163	190.403628	kevin_andrews IN LOCK STEP WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF
190.717098	191.750385	kevin_andrews SAYING THAT
191.970975	193.097143	kevin_andrews IT'S TIME THAT
193.433832	196.011247	kevin_andrews A NATIONAL DISABILITY INSURANCE SCHEME WAS PUT IN PLACE
